				<p class="tittle">the Fist of Shadow</p>
				<h1 class="name">Akali</h1>
				<p class="description">A prodigy in the fighting arts, Akali is a member of the martial order known as the Kinkou. She succeeds her mother as the Fist of Shadow, entrusted with the sacred duty to end those who would bring imbalance to her homeland. While some find her methods extreme, Akali is judicious in maintaining harmony across Ionia.</p>

				<p class="tittle">the Spirit Walker</p>
				<h1 class="name">Udyr</h1>	
				<p class="description">Udyr is more than a man; he is a vessel for the untamed power of four primal animal spirits. When tapping into the spirits' bestial natures, Udyr can harness their unique strengths: The tiger grants him speed and ferocity, the turtle resilience, the bear might, and the phoenix its eternal flame. With their combined power, Udyr can turn back all those who would attempt to harm the natural order.</p>

			<div class="panel_content">
				<p class="tittle">the Tiny Master of Evil</p>
				<h1 class="name">Veigar</h1>
				<p class="description">An enthusiastic master of dark sorcery, Veigar has embraced powers that few mortals dare approach. As a free-spirited inhabitant of Bandle City, he longed to push beyond the limitations of yordle magic, and turned instead to arcane texts that had been hidden away for thousands of years. Now a stubborn creature with an endless fascination for the mysteries of the universe, Veigar is often underestimated by others—but even though he believes himself truly evil, he possesses an inner morality that leads some to question his deeper motivations.</p>

			<div class="panel_content">
				<p class="tittle">the Sad Mummy</p>
				<h1 class="name">Amumu</h1>	
				<p class="description">Legend claims that Amumu is a lonely and melancholy soul from ancient Shurima, roaming the world in search of a friend. Doomed by an ancient curse to remain alone forever, his touch is death, his affection ruin. Those who claim to have seen him describe a living cadaver, small in stature and wrapped in creeping bandages. Amumu has inspired myths, songs, and folklore told and retold for generations—such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction.</p>

			<div class="panel_content">
				<p class="tittle">the Bounty Hunter</p>
				<h1 class="name">MissFortune</h1>
				<p class="description">A Bilgewater captain famed for her looks but feared for her ruthlessness, Sarah Fortune paints a stark figure among the hardened criminals of the port city. As a child, she witnessed the reaver king Gangplank murder her family—an act she brutally avenged years later, blowing up his flagship while he was still aboard. Those who underestimate her will face a beguiling and unpredictable opponent… and, likely, a bullet or two in their guts.</p>

		<div class="panel panel6">
			<div class="panel_content">
				<p class="tittle">the Kraken Priestess</p>
				<h1 class="name">Illaoi</h1>
				<p class="description">Illaoi’s powerful physique is dwarfed only by her indomitable faith. As the prophet of the Great Kraken, she uses a huge, golden idol to rip her foes’ spirits from their bodies and shatter their perception of reality. All who challenge the “Truth Bearer of Nagakabouros” soon discover Illaoi never battles alone—the god of the Serpent Isles fights by her side.</p>

		<div class="panel panel7">
			<div class="panel_content">
				<p class="tittle">the Bloodharbor Ripper</p>
				<h1 class="name">Pyke</h1>
				<p class="description">A renowned harpooner from the slaughter docks of Bilgewater, Pyke should have met his death in the belly of a gigantic jaull-fish… and yet, he returned. Now, stalking the dank alleys and backways of his former hometown, he uses his new supernatural gifts to bring a swift and gruesome end to those who make their fortune by exploiting others—and a city that prides itself on hunting monsters now finds a monster hunting them.</p>
